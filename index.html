            <p>I have a small garden that I tend every morning; it is the best time to start a 
               day for me. Gardening is my meditation.</p>

            <p>Seldom I will get bored; I travel to places through the mind. People think I am 
                good-tempered, in actuality, my mind finds things to do. It includes that I 
                engage myself in problem-solving, which I enjoy very much. Through every 
                trial-and-error, I learn something. I appreciate that mistakes, uncomfortable or 
                not, are windows of opportunity for me to become stronger and better.</p>
            
            <p>The world is big and beautiful that I have not traveled much. I hope to do it 
                someday with my sketchbook. Would you think the Bootcamp will bring me closer 
                to the dream?</p>
