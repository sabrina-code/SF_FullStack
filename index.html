            <p>I have always hoped to be a developer who designs or a designer who codes. Technology is advanced in such a way that more creative freedom is available if one is versatile and good at the tools. I am thrilled to have become a student at UCLA Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp. I hope to become a software engineer in web or multimedia fields who understands visuals.</p>

            <p>Being a passionate, visual person, I am also analytical and scientific. I particularly love problem-solving and appreciate the process of critical thinking to make an impossibility a possibility. I have spent a lot of time reading, learning, executing, failing, and succeeding. I love the fact that every failure is a window of opportunity for me to learn to become better and stronger.<p>
            
            <p>Aside from being enthusiastic about web development, my other notable habit is gardening. I have a small garden that I tend in the morning. Gardening is my meditation every day. It is the best way for me to start a day fresh.</p>
